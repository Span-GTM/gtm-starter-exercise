# Stephen Poletto

## Role & Scope

I lead the GTM organization at Span, with ARR (new sales, expansion, and
retention) as my primary metric. I'm responsible for building the GTM
team, maintaining a healthy pipeline, supporting current customers, and
partnering with prospects to help close new business.

## Communication Preferences

I'm an inbox-zero person --- email is the most reliable way to get
something done. I have a well-honed workflow that ensures nothing slips
through the cracks. Slack is useful but inherently more chaotic, so
things are more likely to be dropped there.

-   **For anything requiring clear action → email me.**
-   **For brainstorming, idea-sharing, or casual conversation → Slack is
    fine.**

## Work Cadence

I strongly prefer to keep mornings free for heads-down work. Early calls
drain my energy and reduce my capacity for creative or strategic work
later in the day.

-   Please avoid scheduling meetings before **9am PT** unless you
    explicitly confirm with me.
-   I'm comfortable working into the evening and don't have a strict
    end-of-day cutoff.

## Values in Collaboration

I'm from the East Coast and appreciate **direct communication**. No
sugarcoating --- tell me what you need, when something is off, or when I
need to adjust.

I value teammates who: - Focus on delighting customers\
- Prioritize helping the company win\
- Make decisions anchored in these principles

## Behaviors That Slow Me Down

If you request a short-notice meeting, please have a clear agenda.\
Unstructured "catch-up" calls disrupt flow and reduce my ability to get
deep work done. Predictability in my schedule matters.

I'm always responsive to **true urgencies**, especially when there's a
clear expected outcome.

## Receiving Feedback

Any format is fine --- written, direct, async, or synchronous.\
I typically take a moment to process feedback, so don't expect an
immediate in-the-moment reaction.
