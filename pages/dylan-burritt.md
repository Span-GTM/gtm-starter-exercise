# Dylan Burritt

## Role & Scope

I lead the outbound efforts at Span. I'm responsible for building the outbound process, getting creative and documenting results, setting meetings, and ultimately creating a repeatable/scalable process.

## Communication Preferences

Email is the best ways to reach me with any urgent information. I like to have my inbox on zero, so I'm pretty diligent about getting through my emails every day. 

-   **For anything requiring clear action → email me.**
-   **For brainstorming, idea-sharing, or casual conversation → Slack is
    fine.**

## Work Cadence

I strongly prefer to keep mornings free for heads-down work. Early calls
drain my energy and reduce my capacity for creative or strategic work
later in the day.

-   Please avoid scheduling meetings before **9am PT** unless you
    explicitly confirm with me.
-   I'm comfortable working into the evening and don't have a strict
    end-of-day cutoff.

## Values in Collaboration

I value authenticity and not beating around the bush.

I value teammates who: 
- Focus on delighting customers
- Prioritize helping the company win
- Make decisions anchored in these principles

## Behaviors That Slow Me Down

If you request a short-notice meeting, please have a clear agenda.\
Unstructured "catch-up" calls disrupt flow and reduce my ability to get
deep work done. Predictability in my schedule matters.

I'm always responsive to **true urgencies**, especially when there's a
clear expected outcome.

## Receiving Feedback

Any format is fine --- written, direct, async, or synchronous.\
I typically take a moment to process feedback, so don't expect an
immediate in-the-moment reaction.
