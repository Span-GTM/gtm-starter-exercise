# Stephen Poletto

## Role & Scope

I work in People but I also do a lot of random jobs at Span! Chances are if you're looking for the owner of a random job it's probably me. 

## Communication Preferences

I'm a zero inbox person and very active on slack. If I take a while to respond on slack, usually I've seen it and I'm actively working on whatever you've asked for. 
Email takes me longer to respond to but I try and email back by EOD or the next day
I often jump to respond to things as quickly as possible and sometimes have typos etc. I'm not a read twice before sending kind of person. 

## Work Cadence

I'm not a morning person, but I usually do my best thinking in the morning so I tend to source in the mornings. Fridays are for ops 

## Values in Collaboration

I love collaborating but I also love to just get things done as quickly as possible. 

## Behaviors That Slow Me Down

Asks that aren't related to the business needs 

## Receiving Feedback

I do best when you say "Can I give you some feedback" I need the heads up that I'm getting feedback so I can mentally prepare and not jump to respond immediately.
