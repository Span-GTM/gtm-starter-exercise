# Eric Ren

## Role & Scope

I lead Marketing at Span.

## Communication Preferences

Both email and Slack work for me. My only ask is that you make it clear if you need explicit action or input from me, and clarify how urgent it is. I also really like Loom for things that require deeper context.

## Work Cadence

Mornings are chaotic for me with 2 kids and a dog, so I do best with meetings or requests after 9am PT. And often I have family duties from 5-8pm, but can be back online after 8pm to respond or collaborate if needed.

I prefer quick 5 min huddles, 15 min meetings etc. to long Slack and email threads. I miss in person time, being able to jam and whiteboard etc.
