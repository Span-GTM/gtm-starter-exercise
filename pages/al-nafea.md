# Al Nafea

## Role & Scope
Growth Lead - I am in charge of figuring out what permutation of channels, experiments, and other initiatives will grow Span as fast as possible. 


## Communication Preferences
Send me short, sweet, and fast messages. I am very responsive so just be transparent and let me know what you need. Unlike everyone else, getting long formal emails is more stressful to me than 25 Slack messages at once


## Work Cadence
I am pretty much always present. I'm Slack 0.


## Values in Collaboration
I value working with competent & confident teammates. Learning from others is what gives me excitement each work day. 


## Behaviors That Slow Me Down
Unclear messages or emails without a clear CTA
Frequent context shifting will often make me forget what I was prioritizing


## Receiving Feedback
Prefer it informally over formally in a doc or whatever
