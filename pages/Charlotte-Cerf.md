# Charlotte

## Role & Scope

I'm responsible for Customer Success at Span, supporting our full customer journey from initial onboarding, value realization to renewal. 

## Communication Preferences

I prefer email for anything that requires clear action on my part, and Slack for brainstorming or casual conversation. 

-   **For anything requiring clear action → email me.**
-   **For brainstorming, idea-sharing, or casual conversation → Slack is
    fine.**

## Work Cadence

I'm located in Burlington, Vermont in EST.  

-  I have a hard cut

## Values in Collaboration

I'm from the East Coast and appreciate **direct communication**. No
sugarcoating --- tell me what you need, when something is off, or when I
need to adjust.

I value teammates who: 
- Focus on delighting customers
- Prioritize helping the company win
- Make decisions anchored in these principles

## Behaviors That Slow Me Down

If you request a short-notice meeting, please have a clear agenda.\
Unstructured "catch-up" calls disrupt flow and reduce my ability to get
deep work done. Predictability in my schedule matters.

I'm always responsive to **true urgencies**, especially when there's a
clear expected outcome.

## Receiving Feedback

Any format is fine --- written, direct, async, or synchronous.\
I typically take a moment to process feedback, so don't expect an
immediate in-the-moment reaction.
