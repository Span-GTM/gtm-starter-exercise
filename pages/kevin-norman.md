# Kevin Norman

## Role & Scope

I’m an AE, responsible for bringing new business to Span. I partner with engineering, product, and finance leaders to understand their priorities and help them evaluate and adopt Span in a way that delivers clear, defensible outcomes.


## Communication Preferences

As a sales person, I'm all over Slack and email to better serve my customers. So both channels are a great way to reach me. 

## Work Cadence

I am most productive in the morning, but willing to work non-traditional business hours to close business on an as-needed basis. 

## Values in Collaboration

I appreciate direct communication, and I view feedback as a gift. If my working style is clashing with yours or if you see me doing something that is ineffective or inefficient, I would like to know.
