# Parker Haney

## Role & Scope

I am an Account Executive here at Span with ARR (new sales, expansion, and
retention) as my primary metric. I'm responsible for running discoveries, demonstrations, Proof of Concepts, approvals, procurement, and closing

## Communication Preferences

I can be contracted any way that is most convenient for you. If the communication requires a task, email is the preferred method of communication. Slack, Email, and Phone, however, are all perfectly fine.

-   **For anything requiring clear action → email me. parker@span.app
-   **For brainstorming, idea-sharing, or casual conversation → Slack is
    fine.**
-   **Feel free to call me any time @ 415-215-9799**

## Work Cadence

I would like to not have calls before 8am if possible (9am is preferred, I like to get a workout in before I start my day). 

-   If a call is needed before 8am, please ask!
-   I like to end my meetings by 4pm PST if possible. If a meeting is needed after 4pm, please ask!

## Values in Collaboration

I am a feedback seeker. I enjoy learning and growing, and will ask for feedback directly after a meeting, demo, project, etc. No need to sugarcoat anything, I have thick skin and want you to be honest with me! Clear Eyes feedback means you care about me and care about my contributions. I strongly dislike contentious interactions, and will take 2 steps back if I feel conversations are getting heated.

I value teammates who are: 
- collaborative
- team mentality
- have fun with work (being goofy and working hard)

I am always more than happy (and love to) hop on impromptu Zooms to co-work in this remote world.

## Behaviors That Slow Me Down

If you request a short-notice meeting, please have a clear agenda.\
Unstructured "catch-up" calls disrupt flow and reduce my ability to get
deep work done. Predictability in my schedule matters.

I'm always responsive to **true urgencies**, especially when there's a
clear expected outcome.

## Receiving Feedback

I am a big fan of receiving feedback live on a call. Most feedback will come with questions for clarification , and a live call provides an immediate avenue to ask those questions.
